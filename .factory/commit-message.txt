chore(test): enable pytest-benchmark by removing local stub; add utils test runner

- Remove `pytest_benchmark.py`, which shadowed the real `pytest-benchmark` plugin and prevented it from loading.
- Add `.factory/run.sh` helper script that sets up the dev environment (installs extras) and runs `pytest tests/utils`.
