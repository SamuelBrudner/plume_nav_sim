# PlumeNav Roadmap (Phase 3)

This document supersedes historical planning artifacts (`CONTRACTS_V2_PLAN.md`, `REFACTORING_PLAN.md`, `REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md`, `SEMANTIC_AUDIT.md`, `TEST_TAXONOMY.md`). Archived copies now live in `docs/archive/` for reference.

## Current Focus

- **Phase 3 – Documentation & Developer Experience**
  - Deliver simplified onboarding via refreshed `README.md` and curated examples.
  - Align extending documentation with dependency-injection first workflows.
  - Audit top-level artifacts and remove stale environment exports.

## Upcoming Initiatives

- **Phase 4 – Contract Hardening**
  - Promote validated protocol specs in `contracts/*.md` to autogenerated API docs.
  - Expand property-based suites for action/observation/reward components.

- **Phase 5 – Release Enablement**
  - Rebuild `CHANGELOG.md` entries toward a 0.1.0 release candidate.
  - Add packaging automation and publishable wheels.

## Backlog

- Consolidate performance benchmarking scripts into a dedicated `benchmarks/` package.
- Introduce reproducibility reports via `examples/reproducibility.py` into CI artifacts.
- Migrate legacy Gym wrappers once DI becomes default (`DI_DEFAULT_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`).
