    """Sparse binary reward function for goal-reaching tasks.

    Satisfies RewardFunction protocol via duck typing.

    Reward Structure:
        - 1.0 if agent reaches goal (within goal_radius)
        - 0.0 otherwise

    Properties:
        - Deterministic: Same state → same reward
        - Pure: No side effects
        - Finite: Always returns 0.0 or 1.0
        - Memoryless: Only depends on current state, not history

    Example:
        >>> reward_fn = SparseGoalReward(
        ...     goal_position=Coordinates(15, 15),
        ...     goal_radius=1.0
