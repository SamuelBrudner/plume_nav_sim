"""
Lightweight HookManager class implementation for the plume navigation simulation system.

This module provides configurable hook system with near-zero overhead (<1 ms when no hooks 
are configured) and registration APIs for extensible lifecycle event handling. The HookManager
enables pre-step, post-step, and episode-end callbacks that can be dynamically registered
and executed during simulation runtime.

Key Features:
- Zero-overhead early exit when no hooks are registered
- Type-safe hook registration with protocol compliance
- Performance-optimized dispatch with <1 ms overhead
- Hydra configuration-based hook instantiation
- Thread-safe registration for concurrent usage

The implementation maintains the <33 ms/step performance SLA through efficient early-exit
patterns and direct function calls without wrapper overhead.
